## Fundamentals

* Any HTML document must start with document declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>`
* HTML documents begin with `<html>` and ends with `</html>`
* Headings are defined with `<h1>` to `<h6>` where `<h1>` is the highest important heading and `<h6>` is the least important sub-heading.
* Paragrahs are defined in `<p>..</p>` tag.
* Links are defined in `<a>` tag.
    #### Example:
    ```
    <a href="https://onecompiler.com/html">HTML online compiler</a>
    ```
* Images are defined in `<img>` tag, where `src` attribute consists of image name.
* Buttons are defined in `<button>..</button>` tag 
* Lists are defined in `<ul>` for unordered/bullet list and `<ol>` for ordered/number list, and the list items are defined in `<li>`.

## HTML Elements and Attributes

* HTML element is everything present from start tag to end tag.
* The text present between start and end tag is called HTML element content. 
* Anything can be a tagname but it's preferred to put the meaningful title to the content present as tag name.
* Do not forget the end tag.
* Elements with no content are called empty elements.
* Elements can have attributes which provides additional information about the element.
* In the below example, href is an attribute and a is the tag name.
    #### Example:
    ```
    <a href="https://onecompiler.com/html">HTML online compiler</a>
    ```
## CSS

CSS(cascading style sheets) describes how HTML elements will look on the web page like color, font-style, font-size, background color etc.

```css
body{
  padding: 25px;
}
.title {
	color: #228B22;
	font-family: Candara;
}
```

## HTML Tables

* HTML Tables are defined in `<table>` tag.
* Table row should be defined in `<tr>` tag
* Table header should be defined in `<th>` tag
* Table data should be defined in `<td>` tag
* Table caption should be defined in `<caption>` tag

## HTML-Javascript

* Javascript is used in HTML pages to make them more interactive.
* `<script>` is the tag used to write scripts in HTML
* You can either reference a external script or write script code in this tag.

### Example

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
