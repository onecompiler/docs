Getting started with the OneCompiler's VB.net compiler is simple and pretty fast. The editor shows sample boilerplate code when you choose language as `VB.net`. OneCompiler also has reference programs, where you can look for the sample code to get started with.

# Read input from STDIN in VB.net

OneCompiler's VB.net online editor supports stdin and users can give inputs to programs using the STDIN textbox under the I/O tab. Following is a sample VB.net program which takes name as input and prints hello message with your name.

```vb
Public Module Program
	Public Sub Main(args() As string)
	 Dim name as String = Console.ReadLine()    ' Reading input from STDIN
   Console.WriteLine("Hello " & name)               ' Writing output to STDOUT
	End Sub
End Module

# Syntax help

## Variables

Variable is a name given to the storage area in order to identify them in our programs.

Simple syntax of Variable declaration is as follows

```vb
Dim variableName [ As [ New ] dataType ] [ = initializer ]
```
### Variable initialization

```vb
variableName = value
```

## Conditional Statements

### 1. If

```vb
If condition-expression Then 
    'code
End If
```
### 2. If-else

```vb
If(conditional-expression)Then
   'code if the conditional-expression is true 
Else
   'code if the conditional-expression is false 
End If
```

### 3. If-else-if ladder

```vb
If(conditional-expression)Then
        'code if the above conditional-expression is true 
Else If(conditional-expression) Then
        'code if the above conditional-expression is true 
    Else
        'code if the above conditional-expression is false 
End If
```

### 4. Nested-If

```vb
If(conditional-expression)Then
         'code if the above conditional-expression is true
   If(conditional-expression)Then
         'code if the above conditional-expression is true 
   End If
End If
```

### 5. Select Case

```vb
Select [ Case ] expression
   [ Case expressionlist
      'code ]
   [ Case Else
      'code ]
End Select
```
## Loops

### 1. For..Next

```vb
For counter [ As datatype ] = begin To end [ Step step ]
   'code
   [ Continue For ]
   'code
   [ Exit For ]
   'code
Next [ counter ]
```

### 2. For..Each

```vb
For Each element [ As datatype ] In group
   'code
   [ Continue For ]
   'code
   [ Exit For ]
   'code
Next [ element ]
```

### 3. While

```vb
While conditional-expression
   'Code 
   [ Continue While ]
   'Code
   [ Exit While ]
   'Code
End While
```
### 4. Do-while

```vb
Do { While | Until } conditional-expression
   'Code
   [ Continue Do ]
   'Code
   [ Exit Do ]
   'Code
Loop
```
```vb
Do
   'Code
   [ Continue Do ]
   'Code
   [ Exit Do ]
   'Code
Loop { While | Until } conditional-expression
```
## Procedures

Procedure is a sub-routine which contains set of statements. Usually Procedures are written when multiple calls are required to same set of statements which increases re-usuability and modularity.

Procedures are of two types.

### 1. Functions

Functions return a value when they are called.

```vb
[accessModifiers] Function functionName [(parameterList)] As returnType
   'code
End Function
```
### 2. Sub-Procedures

Sub-procedures are similar to functions but they don't return any value.

```vb
Sub ProcedureName (parameterList)
'Code
End Sub
```
