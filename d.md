# D Language Online Compiler

Write, Run & Share D language code online using OneCompiler's D language online compiler for free. It's one of the robust, feature-rich online compilers for D language. Getting started with the OneCompiler's D language compiler is simple and pretty fast. The editor shows sample boilerplate code  when you choose language as `D` and start coding. 

# About D language

D language is a general purpose object oriented programming language similar to C in syntax created by Walter Bright and released in 2001. Dlang is more powerful than C++ as it has gained good features from C++ and also has additional features added. 

* More productive
* Modeling code according to your requirement.
* Very good choice for open source software development.

## Variables

### Syntax
```d
datatype variable-names;
```
## Loops
### 1. If-Else:

When ever you want to perform a set of operations based on a condition If-Else is used.

```c
if(conditional-expression) {
   //code
}
else {
   //code
}
```
You can also use if-else for nested Ifs and If-Else-If ladder when multiple conditions are to be performed on a single variable.

### 2. For:

For loop is used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition.

```c
for(Initialization; Condition; Increment/decrement){  
  //code  
} 
```

### 3. While:

While is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. Usually while is preferred when number of iterations are not known in advance.

```c
while (condition) {  
// code 
}  
```

### 4. Do-While:
Do-while is also used to iterate a set of statements based on a condition. It is mostly used when you need to execute the statements atleast once.

```c
do {  
 // code 
} while (condition); 
```

## Arrays
Array is a collection of similar data which is stored in continuous memory addresses. Array values can be fetched using index.  Index starts from 0 to size-1.

```
data-type array-name [ array-size ];
```

## Functions
Function is a sub-routine which contains set of statements. Usually functions are written when multiple calls are required to same set of statements which increases re-usuability and modularity.

### Syntax
```
return_type function_name(parameters) {  
  //code
}
```

## How to call a Function

```c
function_name (parameters)
```
